# Cascadia_Scorecard
## A companion to assist the scoring process for the game Cascadia

### Motivation
Many games these days have some digital way to help you score your points, as a fair, fast, and easy way to continue your game night.
Until now, Cascadia did not have one.

### How to run
This project needs something that can run a JVM and has javafx. This is what it currently looks like when running properly

### Tests
I used Junit5 to test the more complicated aspects of this code. There is a test class built in already that may be used for further testing.

### Contributors
This code is free to use and may be further expanded by anyone who would like to use the code for themselves.
